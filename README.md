# Queue

An app hell bent on making the lives of resturant managers easier.

This is the ongoing development github repository for the Queue app.
 I dont see it this being public for much longer, if you would like to
 help work on Queue just give me a shout at chriswahlfeldt@gmail.com.
 
`git clone https://github.com/Qveue/Queue.git && cd Queue && npm install`
 and run the app normally on whatever platform.

Testing:
`npm test` or `jest`
