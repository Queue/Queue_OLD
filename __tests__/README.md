# Testing with Jest

Make sure you have jest globally installed as an npm module.
 `npm install -g jest` or just run `npm test` on the
 command line

Testing is simple: just create a test version of the main
 react component/stateless component :)

Tip: Use the others located in `./components` and `./scenes`
 as reference for how to create a test while utilizing the
 original code written.
